    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made of layers of pasta, rich tomato sauce, savory meat or vegetables, and
        creamy cheese, typically ricotta and mozzarella. Baked to perfection, the layers meld together to create a
        comforting, hearty meal that is both flavorful and satisfying. Itâ€™s often seasoned with herbs like basil and
        oregano, and topped with a golden, bubbly cheese crust.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat: Sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef for a rich, savory filling.</li>
        <li>Onion and garlic: Added for enhanced flavor in the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Tomato products: Crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste form the base of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Sugar: A touch of sweetness to balance the acidity of the tomatoes.</li>

            for a flavorful kick.</li>
